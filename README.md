for now, only part of data(Production, Consumption) were imported. Other data (Prices, Trade) were not imported

### Changelog

#### 2025-09-13

- updated with 2025 statistical review of world energy data
- production_reverse were split into multiple datapoints, removed material domain
- removed some obsolete entity domain files
- new indicators for co2 emissions:
  - removed carbon_dioxide_emissions
  - added co2_from_energy, co2_from_flaring, co2_process_emissions_methane, co2e_emissions
